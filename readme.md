<h2> You will need Nodemon as a Dev Dependency</h2>
<h2> You will need Chalk@4.1.2 as a Dependency</h2>

<p>You will need Nodemon because I have a script in package.json which will automatically run the application after every file save I make</p>

<p> Chalk is just for some Misc stuff, for example when you run the app it will display **[SERVER]** In a different colour </p>
